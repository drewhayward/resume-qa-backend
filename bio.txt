(Work history)
I'm currently a Research Assistant at Michigan State University. Most of my research
has involved question answering models and language understanding.

In the Summer of 2019 I developed a prototype app for Edgewater Safety Systems.
The app recorded and scheduled messages to play on a web dashboard for elderly
patients suffering from dementia.

I interned at OSIsoft in 2017. While there, I helped develop and maintain
an internal company dashboard written in AngularJS and C#.

I'm interested in ML Engineering, Natural Language interfaces, and deploying
real-world systems.

(Education)
I have a BS in Computer Science from Grove City College, and I'm in the Masters
program at Michigan State University.

(Skills)
I have experience with Python, Javascript, Golang, C#, C++ and Java.


(Misc)
When I'm not coding or reading interesting papers, I like to run, play mandolin,
cook and throw a frisbee.

(How is this model built?)
This system is built from the recent, text-generation based UnifiedQA. I deployed
the smallest version of this model using the huggingface transformers libary and
deploy the model with a fixed context (my bio).
